                    // question:
                    // condition : comment vTaskSuspend(taskHandle_dcMotor);
                    // some times the priority of dcMotor will react in wired way.
                    // wheel would spins quickly, but priority of DCmotor would be 1, which is less than taskHandle_PlaySong
                    // why?
                    // cause when the priority of other task increased, the DCmotor task may be in 'running state', the stack or process is used. => conflict happens.
